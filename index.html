                        <pa><br>Alpha Squad Adventures is a Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) game about rescuing aliens through the use of empathy. The goal is to teach children appropriate social interactions and behavior through non-violent gameplay that focuses on emotional responses. Most importantly, the game is expected to emphasize the parent-child dynamic, where players have to gain trust of the aliens, rescue them from the dangerous environment, nurture and prepare them to be released back to their home planet, and eventually release them.</br>
